## **About**

Recall is a Discord logging bot that records user messages and logs them in a secure database per server. It utilizes **Node.js**, **Discord.js** and **sqlite3** to deliver these features to each server. Recall can display how many times a user has said a certain word (if at all), or just the user / server's general message activity.
