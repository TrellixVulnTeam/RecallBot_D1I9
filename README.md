## **About**

Recall is a Discord logging bot that records user messages and logs them in a secure database per server. It utilizes **Node.js**, **Discord.js** and **sqlite3** to deliver these features to each server. Recall can display how many times a user has said a certain word (if at all), or just the user / server's general message activity. You can invite Recall to your Discord server with [**this link**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=995910893667893298&permissions=8&scope=bot).
